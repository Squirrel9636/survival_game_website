                This a new take on the survival game
                genre.The players goal is to conquer the
                island they are in.The island is dominated
                by prehistoric dinosaurs.The player must defeat
                the dinos to survive or possibly befriend them.
                If you manage to befriend the dinosaurs they are
                pretty much half way there.Befriending or taming
                dinos is really helpful to the survivor.They provide
                tons of utility.

                Gameplay
            </h1>
            <p>
                The game starts of with you stranded on an island.
                Moments later you realize that the island contains
                prehistoric animals.Some of which are friendly 
                while others,not so much.So you start getting new
                resources maybe by hitting rocks or cutting trees.
                You start to make new equipments and buildings.After
                making a good weapon you try to fight one of the dinos
                but you may die and lose everything.But that should 
                not stop you from striving for survival.Another
                element of the game is taming which is explained 
                briefly in section below.Its a mechanism to make friends
                with the creatures.

                The idea of taming creatures
            </h1>
            <p class="offset-p">
                To survive the elements the players must defeat other
                creatures or take another route and actually turn the elements
                into their friends.This is where taming comes in.If the player just like
                in modern life gives food
